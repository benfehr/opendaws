            <p class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-2"> Music production is famously elitist, with even the simplest music set ups at 
                home costing thousands. The aim of Open Daw is to make the same available for
                everyone.</p>
            <p class="flexbox-item flexbox-item-3"> Those who sign up will have access to all open studio days, group mentoring 
                sessions, event tickets, and the opportunity to share their own work with the entire
                community of users.</p>
